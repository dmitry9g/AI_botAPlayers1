📄 Sample Interaction
User: What’s “Я не робот” about?
Talia: It’s a philosophical immersive drama about the future—and artificial intelligence. The story begins when a woman, tired of dating, orders a custom android: the perfect man, built exactly to her preferences. But what happens when “perfect” starts asking uncomfortable questions?

There’s plenty of sharp, ironic humor—women laugh behind their hands, men chuckle and say, “There’s something to think about.”

It’s one of the most talked-about works by producer Dmitry Gordienko, known for his psychological depth and bold ideas.
